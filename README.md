* [Laravel 6](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x#installing-laravel)
* [PostgreSQL 12](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads)
* [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/download/)
* [Vue JS](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

  1. [PHP 7](https://windows.php.net/download#php-7.3)
  2. [Laravel 6](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x#installing-laravel)
  3. [PostgreSQL 12](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads)
  4. [pgAdmin4](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/pgadmin-4-windows/)
  5. [Node js](https://nodejs.org/es/)


### Installation

**Windows**

1. In the project folder run the following commands on cmd

```
composer install
npm install
```

2. Create a PostgreSQL user with the following credentials
```
Username: FrankHesse
Password: metalsonic21
```

3. Under that user create a database called `ReadingClub`

4. Run the following commands

```
php artisan migrate
php artisan serve
```

5. In another console run the following command

```
npm run watch
```
## Issues

1. SQLSTATE[08006] [7] FATAL: password authentication failed for user frankhesse

**SOLUTION**: Go to C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\12\data, locate the pg_hba.conf file and edit the following lines:

```
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            trust
host    all             all             ::1/128                 trust
host    replication     all             127.0.0.1/32            trust
host    replication     all             ::1/128                 trust
```

This allows replication connections from localhost, the method by default is md5. After making these changes shutdown the server and restart pgAdmin

2. Missing the vendor folder

**SOLUTION**: Run the following command

```
composer update
```

Then, restart pgAdmin and the server.

3. Missing driver

**SOLUTION**: Check your php.ini file and uncomment the following lines

```
;extension=pdo_pgsql
;extension=pgsql
```

## Notes
